;;
;; Install:
;; From melpa, `M-x package-install RET mdopen-mode RET`.
;; Add the following to your `init.el`:
;; ```emacs-lisp
;; (use-package mdopen-mode
;;   :ensure t
;;   :bind (:map markdown-mode-command-map
;;          ("m" . mdopen-mode)))
;; ```
;; Run `M-x mdopen-mode` to preview a Markdown file with your defined preferences.
